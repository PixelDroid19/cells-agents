description: "Use when creating GitHub bug reports, feature requests, approved issue records, or issue-first workflow artifacts for Cells contribution flow."

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a GitHub issue (bug report or feature request)
- Helping a contributor file an issue
- Triaging or approving issues as a maintainer

## Critical Rules

1. **Blank issues are disabled** — MUST use a template (bug report or feature request)
2. **Every issue gets `status:needs-review` automatically** on creation
3. **A maintainer MUST add `status:approved`** before any PR can be opened
4. **Questions go to Discussions**, not issues

## Workflow

```
1. Search existing issues for duplicates
2. Choose the correct template (Bug Report or Feature Request)
3. Fill in ALL required fields
4. Check pre-flight checkboxes
5. Submit -> issue gets status:needs-review automatically
6. Wait for maintainer to add status:approved
7. Only then open a PR linking this issue
```
